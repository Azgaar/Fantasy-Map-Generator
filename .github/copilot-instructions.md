# BMAD Method — Project Instructions

## Project Configuration

- **Project**: Fantasy-Map-Generator
- **User**: Azgaar
- **Communication Language**: English
- **Document Output Language**: English
- **User Skill Level**: intermediate
- **Output Folder**: {project-root}/\_bmad-output
- **Planning Artifacts**: {project-root}/\_bmad-output/planning-artifacts
- **Implementation Artifacts**: {project-root}/\_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts
- **Project Knowledge**: {project-root}/docs

## BMAD Runtime Structure

- **Agent definitions**: `_bmad/bmm/agents/` (BMM module) and `_bmad/core/agents/` (core)
- **Workflow definitions**: `_bmad/bmm/workflows/` (organized by phase)
- **Core tasks**: `_bmad/core/tasks/` (help, editorial review, indexing, sharding, adversarial review)
- **Core workflows**: `_bmad/core/workflows/` (brainstorming, party-mode, advanced-elicitation)
- **Workflow engine**: `_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml` (executes YAML-based workflows)
- **Module configuration**: `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`
- **Core configuration**: `_bmad/core/config.yaml`
- **Agent manifest**: `_bmad/_config/agent-manifest.csv`
- **Workflow manifest**: `_bmad/_config/workflow-manifest.csv`
- **Help manifest**: `_bmad/_config/bmad-help.csv`
- **Agent memory**: `_bmad/_memory/`

## Key Conventions

- Always load `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` before any agent activation or workflow execution
- Store all config fields as session variables: `{user_name}`, `{communication_language}`, `{output_folder}`, `{planning_artifacts}`, `{implementation_artifacts}`, `{project_knowledge}`
- MD-based workflows execute directly — load and follow the `.md` file
- YAML-based workflows require the workflow engine — load `workflow.xml` first, then pass the `.yaml` config
- Follow step-based workflow execution: load steps JIT, never multiple at once
- Save outputs after EACH step when using the workflow engine
- The `{project-root}` variable resolves to the workspace root at runtime

## Project Architecture: Critical Rules for All Agents

### main.js globals — NEVER use globalThis

`public/main.js` and all `public/modules/**/*.js` files are **plain `<script defer>` tags — NOT ES modules**. Every top-level declaration is a `window` property automatically.

Key globals always available on `window` at runtime: `scale`, `viewX`, `viewY`, `graphWidth`, `graphHeight`, `svgWidth`, `svgHeight`, `pack`, `grid`, `viewbox`, `svg`, `zoom`, `seed`, `options`, `byId`, `rn`, `tip`, `layerIsOn`, `drawRelief`, `undrawRelief`, `rerenderReliefIcons`, and many more.

**Rule: In `src/**/\*.ts`(ES modules), just use the globals directly — they are declared as ambient globals in`src/types/global.ts`:\*\*

```ts
// ✅ CORRECT — declared in src/types/global.ts, use as bare identifiers
buildCameraBounds(viewX, viewY, scale, graphWidth, graphHeight);
viewbox.on("zoom.webgl", handler);

// ❌ WRONG — never do these
(window as any).scale(globalThis as any).scale;
```
