# Versioning

<!-- Update the VERSION if you want the PR to be merged. Currently it's a manual 3-steps process:
  * update VERSION in `versioning.js` using semver principle
  * for all changed files update hash (the part after `?`) in place where file is requested (usually it's `index.html`)
  * if the change can be really interesting for end-users, describe it inside the `showUpdateWindow()` function in `versioning.js` -->

- [ ] Version is updated
- [ ] Changed files hash is updated
