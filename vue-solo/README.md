# Fantasy Map Generator (ES6/7 port)

## Refactoring Goal

Take the original scripts.js and index.html and convert them into modules so that developers can work on more manageable files with fewer lines of code and use the latest es6/7 syntax support leveraging VueJS without webpack. In the end, the files could be built and deployed as a single, minified file.
