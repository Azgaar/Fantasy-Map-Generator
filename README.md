If you face performance issues, please try to open the page in a small window and use the default graph size only. In Firefox fast map zooming may cause browser crush.

The desktop application (Electron) is [under development](https://github.com/mamokin/Fantasy-Map-Generator/tree/code-cleanup-from-boilerplate).
